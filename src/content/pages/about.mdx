    My name is Al Nahean, and I'm a passionate developer and creator building for the modern web. My journey into technology started with a simple curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a career dedicated to building useful, elegant, and accessible digital experiences.

    This website serves as my digital gardenâ€”a place to share what I'm learning, the projects I'm building, and the ideas I'm exploring.

## What I Do

I specialize in full-stack development with a strong focus on the user experience. I believe that the best products are born from a deep understanding of both technology and design.

<div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 my-8">
  <Card className="pl-4">
    {/* 
      FIX APPLIED HERE:
      The entire content of the card is wrapped in a single <span> tag.
      This tells MDX to treat this block as a single unit and prevents it from
      adding an extra <p> tag, which would conflict with the <p> tag you have inside.
    */}
    <span>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <Globe className="size-8 text-primary" />
        <h3 className="!m-0 text-xl font-semibold">Frontend Development</h3>
      </div>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground !m-0">
        I build responsive, fast, and interactive user interfaces using modern
        frameworks like Next.js and React.
      </p>
    </span>
  </Card>
  <Card className="pl-4">
    {/* FIX APPLIED HERE (SAME AS ABOVE) */}
    <span>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <Server className="size-8 text-primary" />
        <h3 className="!m-0 text-xl font-semibold">Backend & Infrastructure</h3>
      </div>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground !m-0">
        I design and implement scalable server-side logic, databases, and
        deployment pipelines to power applications.
      </p>
    </span>
  </Card>
</div>

## My Philosophy

I'm driven by the principle of continuous improvement and a love for open-source. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and sharing knowledge with the community.

<Callout icon="ðŸ’¡" type="default">
  {/*
    FIX APPLIED HERE:
    The text is wrapped in a <span> to prevent MDX from wrapping it in a <p> tag,
    which resolves the nested paragraph error.
  */}
  <span>
    I'm always exploring new technologies and seeking out better ways to solve
    problems. If you have a challenge or an idea, I'd love to hear about it!
  </span>
</Callout>

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not at my keyboard, you can usually find me:

- Exploring the great outdoors on a hike.
- Lost in a good book (usually sci-fi or non-fiction).
- Experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
- Contributing to open-source projects that I admire.
